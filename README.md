# CS207Project
My project for CS207, 2017 Fall term

The project I have created is an enhanced Pong game on the Arduino. The original version uses two potentiometers to play a two player game of Pong.

My version plays with potentiometers, photoresistors, temperature sensors, as well as the option to play against a computer. You will need an RCA cable, two photoresistors, temperature sensors, and potentiometers, although only 1 of any of the sensors you want to play with is required if you are playing single player.
